## Features

(‚úîÔ∏è Done, üü† Rolling-Out / To Finish / WIP, ‚ö™ TODO, ‚ùå May release in near future)

- üü† Commands, Command Parsing:
  CB_CI parses commands in a fast way by subdividing the string into multiple parts, it allows for usage of a different Prefix, Argument Separator.
  Commands are easier to implement and maintain since the Commands module provides a CommandBuilder where you can input everything you need in your command (current arguments of CommandBuilder.new: Name, Permission, Callback. Settings are oncoming)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Permissions and Permission Groups:
  With CB_CI you can create your own permissions and permission groups by using the **builders/PermissionGroupBuilder** or **Permission** Modules!
- üü† Settings:
  With the settings you can customize more than just basic aspects of the Module, you can manipulate more than just a few values. It allows for full pledged customization of aspects of the module without having to know how to script!
- ‚ö™ Commands Addons:
  CB_CI implements an Addon API for you to use in your commands; create your own Addon and use it in your commands by calling AddonApi.GetAddon(AddonName) or get a list of addons using AddonApi.GetAddons()!
- ‚ùå UI:
  CB_CI has the ability to give out UI to certain permissiongroups when joining (requires calling a function on join!)
- üü† Different Types of Commands:
  CB_CI offers a variety of different commands by default, varying from Fun commands all the way to utilitary commands and moderation commands. (ex. /walkeffect: Fun, /kick: Moderation, /reset: Utilitary)
